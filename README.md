# Chronometer
The purpose of this app is to measure accurately the time that users spend in an activity.

This is a simple App, using React's new features, __Hooks__, which allow users to use state management and perform effects on functional components.

This is a Timer and Countdown. It is possible to switch between both and enter a number of seconds for the countdown.

It's just a single component where we handle states and styles.

Languages and technologies:

# JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, React, Hooks.
